* Wiki
This repo implements a live tracking utility for software tasks. It uses
emacs org mode both for task management, and for rendering the status
tracker, which is available at [[https://status.visiondaodev.com][status.visiondaodev.com]].

** Development
Org files for this repo are available in the [[https://github.com/Vision-DAO/wiki/tree/main/content][content directory]].
Edit these files however you wish. Changes are not reflected until
published until the corresponding HTML files are updated by running
=M-x org-publish-current-project=, and pushing to the master branch of
this repo. Builds are handled by Vercel's edge deployment platform.
Users are authenticated via a hard-coded list of "allowed" ethereum
addresses in the [[https://github.com/Vision-DAO/wiki/blob/main/middleware.ts][middleware.ts]] file.
