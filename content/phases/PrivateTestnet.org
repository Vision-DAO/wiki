#+TITLE: Private Test Net Roadmap
#+AUTHOR: Dowland Aiello
#+DATE: 06/22/2022

* TODO Private Test Net [0/2]

Vision's test-net release will be gradually rolled out in two phases: a private test-net release, and a public test-net release. The former will be largely closed-source, operate in a sandboxed environment, and be accessible to only trusted partners.

- /ETA: Dec 2022/
** TODO Enterprise infrastructure
- Develop sandboxed deployment environments that shield as much of the Vision codebase as possible from clients, while exposing features that require testing
** TODO Field Testing
- Discover bugs, and stress-test Vision features in a sandboxed environment with trusted enterprise partners, including Gaza SkyGeeks, and TechAid + IBM
- Offer services for developing Vision solutions with desirable partners, and asissting with their deployments
- Continuously deploy patched instances of the Vision software after internal testing
