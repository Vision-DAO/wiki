* TODO Vision Operating System [0/10]

DEADLINE: <2022-12-30 Fri>
** TODO Dependency-Based Discovery

A module that provides a basic mechanism for discovering modules, based on detecting dependencies between applications and DAO's. Essentially a symbol table for applications written on Vision that DAO applications must import to be able to interface with them. Can be used to traverse the network and find new modules.

** TODO Window Server API

A module that allows modules provided by DAO's to render windows to the user's screen, in designated locations. Layout-agnostic: does not specify how, or where windows should be laid out.

** TODO UI Theme API [0/1]

A module that allows Vision modules to alter, read, and specify new theming variables. Consumed by:

*** TODO Playful Vision Layout

A module that implements a playful, user-friendly Vision workspace layout. Intended for basic, fairly limited usage of the platform, but very accessible to many users. Provides a default theme configuration tuned to the [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/928680821571878922/967206294064873563/unknown.png][Vision Color Palette]].

** TODO Metadata Interface [0/2]

A collection of modules that accept queries for different types of metadata, each identified by their respective module. Modules are unique in the metadata they produce.

*** TODO Module Payload Interface

A module that allows clients to query DAO's for a list of the modules they provide, and the IPLD DAG address of the WebAssembly payload associated with an identified module.

*** TODO DAO Markdown Overview Interface

A metadata module that allows users to view an overview of a DAO, written in Markdown, and rendered to the browser.

** TODO Token Model [0/1]

A module that implements ERC-20 tokens for the DAO's that use the module. A common dependency for modules that require a fungible unit of exchange.

*** TODO Treasury

A module that implements proposal-bound transfers from an account owned by a Vision DAO. Relies on the Proposal System to determine when proposals have been finalized. Generic over any voting strategy. Allows for funding relationships, where a parent DAO can establish scheduled transfers from its treasury to a designated address.

** TODO Proposal System [0/1]

A module that implements a common interface for triggerable changes in the state of a module's metadata, specifically its module payloads.

*** TODO Voting Interface [0/2]

A library of modules that implement various strategies for finalizing proposals on Vision. Assumes that each emits a ~prop_finalized~ event at some point.

**** TODO Quadratic Voting

A module that implements the quadratic voting strategy. N votes by a user cost \[n^2\] tokens. Depends on the [[*Token Model][token model]] module to delegate votes to users in sensible proportions.

**** TODO Share Voting

A module that implements a one-token-one-vote voting strategy. N votes by a user cost \[n\] tokens. Depends on the [[*Token Model][token model]] module to allocate votes.

** TODO Parent-Child Discovery

A module that traverses funding relationships from one DAO to another. Used in conjunction with other discovery techniques.

** TODO Gossip Discovery

A module that allows clients to discover Vision DAO's that are completely unconnected to other DAO's (though such a circumstance is very unlikely). Operates in conjunction with other discovery techniques. Relies on libp2p gossipsub protocol.

** TODO Visibility [0/2]

A suite of modules that makes DAO's visible, and easily discoverable by users. A front-end for underlying discovery mechanisms.

*** TODO Search

A simple, markdown metadata-based fuzzy searching engine that displays DAO's on Vision that contain specified criteria.

*** TODO Mind Map

An interactive display for discovered DAO's on Vision. Emphasizes the presence of financial and logical dependency relationships through a mind-map model.

** TODO Collaboration [0/2]

Tools available, per DAO that allow for discussion of Vision activities without leaving Vision.

*** TODO Chat

A live chat-room module that allows users to discuss the activities of a DAO without leaving Vision. Uses a naive user implementation based solely on Ethereum addresses, and blockie avatars.

*** TODO Discussion pages

Enhanced discussion pages reminiscent of Reddit, where users create threads, and post comments under threads. One board per DAO. Same user implementation as [[*Chat][chat]] module.
